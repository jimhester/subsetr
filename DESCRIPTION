Title: Drop-in Replacements for `[.data.frame` and `subset.data.frame` with Non-Standard Evaluation

Description: subsetr uses tidy evaluation principles developed in 'rlang' to provide
  `subset.data.frame()` and `[.data.frame()` methods which use tidy non-standard
  evaluation.
  For most cases they provide drop in replacements for the existing methods, but
  can also avoid repetitive subsetting code. Because 'rlang' provides robust
  lexical scoping they are suitable for use in top level scripts, functions and
  packages.
